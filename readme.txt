#AVL TREE
Input- 

First line gives choice to the user to perform any operation user wants. 

1 – Insert elements to the AVL tree.If user has chosen this option next line indicates number of elements user wants to add (say n). Than the following n lines will have 1 element each. 

2- Delete an element from AVL tree.On the next line user can chose the element to be deleted from the AVL tree. 

3-Display the elements of AVL tree using inorder and preorder traversal.

4-Search for an element in the AVL tree. On next line user can select the element that the user wants to search in the tree. 

5-Quit 

 

Output- 

Program gives 2 types of outputs 

1)User wants to display the element of the tree than first line indicates preorder tranversal and next line indicates inorder traversal. Combination of preorder and inorder uniquely identifies a binary search tree. 

2)If user searches for an element in the AVL tree than successful search results in 1 and unsuccessful search results in –1.
